# My Notes
TO DO NEXT:
- force push this to GitHub!
- plan and make leaderboard:
  - pandas too cumbersome when adding rows - just csv as before (NumPy overkill?)

TO DO:
- learn about [amending commits](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/edit-project-history.html#amend-commit) 
- save question stats for each set of rounds played? (qtext, character, iscorrect)
- implement OOP?
- see Jupyter TO DO
- add a 'correct' variable in TFs, so instead of T or F, it gives the correct 'answer'
- MC questions when df_remaining low, alternate plans
    including for when limiting df at start (for 'easy')
    so cat_values should be full, but limit after?
- funct returning 5, only using 3 now:
    save all 5 or trim return?
- make scores.csv file, with date
- ? test making same project repo but starting from GitHub (HPquiz_pd_2)

QUESTIONS:
- where are my local git repositories stored? I don't see in project folders
- can I have a difference gitignore file for local and remote repository of same project?
- how to document Python venv on public repos?
- why is "DO NEXT:" at top pink, but not below??
